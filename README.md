## Installation

Install dbx

```r
install.packages("dbx")
```

And follow the instructions for your database

- [Postgres](#postgres)
- [MySQL & MariaDB](#mysql--mariadb)
- [SQLite](#sqlite)
- [SQL Server](#sql-server)
- [Redshift](#redshift)
- [Others](#others)

To install with [Jetpack](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack), use:

```r
jetpack::add("dbx")
```

### Postgres

Install the R package

```r
install.packages("RPostgres")
```

And use:

```r
library(dbx)

db <- dbxConnect(adapter="postgres", dbname="mydb")
```

You can also pass `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `url`.

> Works with RPostgreSQL as well

### MySQL & MariaDB

Install the R package

```r
install.packages("RMySQL")
```

And use:

```r
library(dbx)

db <- dbxConnect(adapter="mysql", dbname="mydb")
```

You can also pass `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `url`.

> Works with RMariaDB as well

### SQLite

Install the R package

```r
install.packages("RSQLite")
```

And use:

```r
library(dbx)

db <- dbxConnect(adapter="sqlite", dbname=":memory:")
```

### SQL Server

Install the R package

```r
install.packages("odbc")
```

And use:

```r
library(dbx)

db <- dbxConnect(adapter=odbc::odbc(), database="mydb")
```

You can also pass `uid`, `pwd`, `server`, and `port`.

### Redshift

For Redshift, follow the [Postgres instructions](#postgres).

### Others

Install the appropriate R package and use:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(adapter=odbc::odbc(), database="mydb")
```

## Operations

### Select

Create a data frame of records from a SQL query

```r
records <- dbxSelect(db, "SELECT * FROM forecasts")
```

Pass parameters

```r
dbxSelect(db, "SELECT * FROM forecasts WHERE period = ? AND temperature > ?", params=list("hour", 27))
```

Parameters can also be vectors

```r
dbxSelect(db, "SELECT * FROM forecasts WHERE id IN (?)", params=list(1:3))
```

### Insert

Insert records

```r
table <- "forecasts"
records <- data.frame(temperature=c(32, 25))
dbxInsert(db, table, records)
```

If you use auto-incrementing ids in Postgres, you can get the ids of newly inserted rows by passing the column name:

```r
dbxInsert(db, table, records, returning=c("id"))
```

### Update

Update records

```r
records <- data.frame(id=c(1, 2), temperature=c(16, 13))
dbxUpdate(db, table, records, where_cols=c("id"))
```

Use `where_cols` to specify the columns used for lookup. Other columns are written to the table.

> Updates are batched when possible, but often need to be run as multiple queries. We recommend upsert when possible for better performance, as it can always be run as a single query. Turn on logging to see the difference.

### Upsert

*Available for PostgreSQL 9.5+, MySQL 5.5+, SQLite 3.24+, and SQL Server 2008+*

*Atomically* insert if they don’t exist, otherwise update them

```r
records <- data.frame(id=c(2, 3), temperature=c(20, 25))
dbxUpsert(db, table, records, where_cols=c("id"))
```

Use `where_cols` to specify the columns used for lookup. There must be a unique index on them, or an error will be thrown.

To skip existing rows instead of updating them, use:

```r
dbxUpsert(db, table, records, where_cols=c("id"), skip_existing=TRUE)
```

If you use auto-incrementing ids in Postgres, you can get the ids of newly upserted rows by passing the column name:

```r
dbxUpsert(db, table, records, where_cols=c("id"), returning=c("id"))
```

### Delete

Delete specific records

```r
bad_records <- data.frame(id=c(1, 2))
dbxDelete(db, table, where=bad_records)
```

Delete all records (uses `TRUNCATE` when possible for performance)

```r
dbxDelete(db, table)
```

### Execute

Execute a statement

```r
dbxExecute(db, "UPDATE forecasts SET temperature = temperature + 1")
```

Pass parameters

```r
dbxExecute(db, "UPDATE forecasts SET temperature = ? WHERE id IN (?)", params=list(27, 1:3))
```

## Logging

Log all SQL queries with:

```r
options(dbx_logging=TRUE)
```

Customize logging by passing a function

```r
logQuery <- function(sql) {
  # your logging code
}

options(dbx_logging=logQuery)
```

## Database Credentials

Environment variables are a convenient way to store database credentials. This keeps them outside your source control. It’s also how platforms like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) store them.

Create an `.Renviron` file in your home directory with:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/dbname
```

Install [urltools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=urltools):

```r
install.packages("urltools")
```

And use:

```r
db <- dbxConnect()
```

If you have multiple databases, use a different variable name, and:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(url=Sys.getenv("OTHER_DATABASE_URL"))
```

You can also use a package like [keyring](https://cran.r-project.org/package=keyring).

## Batching

By default, operations are performed in a single statement or transaction. This is better for performance and prevents partial writes on failures. However, when working with large data frames on production systems, it can be better to break writes into batches. Use the `batch_size` option to do this.

```r
dbxInsert(db, table, records, batch_size=1000)
dbxUpdate(db, table, records, where_cols, batch_size=1000)
dbxUpsert(db, table, records, where_cols, batch_size=1000)
dbxDelete(db, table, records, where, batch_size=1000)
```

## Query Comments

Add comments to queries to make it easier to see where time-consuming queries are coming from.

```r
options(dbx_comment=TRUE)
```

The comment will be appended to queries, like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users /*script:forecast.R*/
```

Set a custom comment with:

```r
options(dbx_comment="hi")
```

## Transactions

To perform multiple operations in a single transaction, use:

```r
DBI::dbWithTransaction(db, {
  dbxInsert(db, ...)
  dbxDelete(db, ...)
})
```

For updates inside a transaction, use:

```r
dbxUpdate(db, transaction=FALSE)
```

## Schemas

To specify a schema, use:

```r
table <- DBI::Id(schema="schema", table="table")
```

## Data Type Notes

### Dates & Times

Dates are returned as `Date` objects and times as `POSIXct` objects. Times are stored in the database in UTC and converted to your local time zone when retrieved.

Times without dates are returned as `character` vectors since R has no built-in support for this type. If you use [hms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hms), you can convert columns with:

```r
records$column <- hms::as_hms(records$column)
```

SQLite does not have support for `TIME` columns, so we recommend storing as `VARCHAR`.

### JSON

JSON and JSONB columns are returned as `character` vectors. You can use [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite) to parse them with:

```r
records$column <- lapply(records$column, jsonlite::fromJSON)
```

SQLite does not have support for `JSON` columns, so we recommend storing as `TEXT`.

### Binary Data

BLOB and BYTEA columns are returned as `raw` vectors.

## Data Type Limitations

### Dates & Times

RSQLite does not currently provide enough info to automatically typecast dates and times. You can manually typecast date columns with:

```r
records$column <- as.Date(records$column)
```

And time columns with:

```r
records$column <- as.POSIXct(records$column, tz="Etc/UTC")
attr(records$column, "tzone") <- Sys.timezone()
```

### Booleans

RMariaDB and RSQLite do not currently provide enough info to automatically typecast booleans. You can manually typecast with:

```r
records$column <- records$column != 0
```

### JSON

RMariaDB does [not currently support JSON](https://github.com/r-dbi/DBI/issues/203).

### Binary Data

RMySQL can write BLOB columns, but [can’t retrieve them directly](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMySQL/issues/123). To workaround this, use:

```r
records <- dbxSelect(db, "SELECT HEX(column) AS column FROM table")

hexToRaw <- function(x) {
  y <- strsplit(x, "")[[1]]
  z <- paste0(y[c(TRUE, FALSE)], y[c(FALSE, TRUE)])
  as.raw(as.hexmode(z))
}

records$column <- lapply(records$column, hexToRaw)
```

### Bigint

BIGINT columns are returned as `numeric` vectors. The `numeric` type in R loses precision above 2<sup>53</sup>. Some libraries (RPostgres, RMariaDB, RSQLite, ODBC) support returning `bit64::integer64` vectors instead.

```r
dbxConnect(bigint="integer64")
```

## Connection Pooling

Install the [pool](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pool) package

```r
install.packages("pool")
```

Create a pool

```r
library(pool)

factory <- function() {
  dbxConnect(adapter="postgres", ...)
}

pool <- poolCreate(factory, maxSize=5)
```

Run queries

```ruby
conn <- poolCheckout(pool)

tryCatch({
  dbxSelect(conn, "SELECT * FROM forecasts")
}, finally={
  poolReturn(conn)
})
```

In the future, dbx commands may work directly with pools.

## Security

When connecting to a database over a network you don’t fully trust, make sure your [connection is secure](https://ankane.org/postgres-sslmode-explained).

With Postgres, use:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(adapter="postgres", sslmode="verify-full", sslrootcert="ca.pem")
```

With RMariaDB, use:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(adapter="mysql", ssl.ca="ca.pem")
```

Please [let us know](https://github.com/ankane/dbx/issues/new) if you have a way that works with RMySQL.

## Variables

Set session variables with:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(variables=list(search_path="archive"))
```

## Timeouts

Set a statement timeout with:

```r
# Postgres
db <- dbxConnect(variables=list(statement_timeout=1000)) # ms

# MySQL 5.7.8+
db <- dbxConnect(variables=list(max_execution_time=1000)) # ms

# MariaDB 10.1.1+
db <- dbxConnect(variables=list(max_statement_time=1)) # sec
```

With Postgres, set a connect timeout with:

```r
db <- dbxConnect(connect_timeout=3) # sec
```

## Compatibility

All connections are simply [DBI](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DBI) connections, so you can use them anywhere you use DBI.

```r
dbCreateTable(db, ...)
```

Install [dbplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dbplyr) to use data with [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr).

```r
forecasts <- tbl(db, "forecasts")
```

## Reference

To close a connection, use:

```r
dbxDisconnect(db)
```
