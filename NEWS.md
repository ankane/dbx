Breaking

- The `dbxInsert` and `dbxUpsert` functions no longer return a data frame by default. For MySQL and SQLite, the data frame was just the `records` argument. For Postgres, if you use auto-incrementing primary keys, the data frame contained ids of the newly inserted/upserted records. To get the ids, pass name of the column as the `returning` argument:

  ```r
  dbxInsert(db, table, records, returning=c("id"))
  ```

- `timestamp without time zone` columns in Postgres are now stored in UTC instead of local time by default. This does not affect `timestamp with time zone` columns. To keep the previous behavior, use:

  ```r
  dbxConnect(adapter="postgres", storage_tz=Sys.timezone(), ...)
  ```

# dbx 0.1.0 (2018-07-05)
